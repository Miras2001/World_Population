# 🌍 World Population Report – Data Analysis Project #2

Continuing to build my data analytics portfolio, I chose to work on a new project focused on **global population trends** using the *World Population Dataset* from Kaggle. This dataset contains 17 columns and thousands of records, providing a rich base for insight generation and visual storytelling.

## 🧹 Data Preparation

The project began with data preparation and cleaning. I used **Excel** to handle the initial steps:

* Removed duplicates
* Trimmed extra spaces
* Adjusted data types for consistency

These steps ensured the dataset was clean and ready for deeper analysis.

## 📊 Data Exploration & SQL Analysis

With the cleaned dataset, I moved on to exploratory data analysis using **SQL in DataGrip**. I performed queries to uncover key insights such as:

* The most and least populated countries
* The **Top 5 most populated countries in Europe**
* Countries with the **largest population growth between 1970 and 2025**

## 📈 Visualization with Power BI

To bring the insights to life, I visualized the findings using **Power BI**. The dashboards include:

* **World Population Distribution**
* **Population Extremes: Most & Least Populated Countries**
* **Europe’s Population Leaders**
* **Population Growth: 1970–2025**

The visuals help communicate complex data stories in a simple, compelling way.
